High-Level Summary: Polynomial Regression Approach for FFB Sensitivity

	1.	Define the Problem Scope:
	•	Input Data: Car attributes (weight, drivetrain type, lock-to-lock rotation) and surface type (gravel, tarmac, snow).
	•	Output: FFB sensitivity values for each car on each surface.
	2.	Prepare the Data:
	•	Collect a dataset with FFB sensitivity values for a representative sample of cars.
	•	Encode drivetrain types numerically (e.g., RWD = 1, FWD = 2, AWD = 3).
	•	Normalize or scale numerical values (e.g., weight and lock-to-lock rotation) for better modeling.
	3.	Choose a Model:
	•	Use polynomial regression to model the relationships. This involves:
	•	Adding polynomial features (e.g., squares or cross-products of weight, rotation, and drivetrain).
	•	Including interaction terms to capture how attributes influence each other (e.g., weight × rotation).
	4.	Train and Validate:
	•	Split the sample dataset into training and validation sets.
	•	Train the polynomial regression model to predict FFB sensitivity.
	•	Validate the model’s performance using metrics like error rates or residual analysis.
	5.	Predict for Full Dataset:
	•	Use the trained model to calculate FFB sensitivities for all cars and surfaces in the dataset.
	•	Optionally, train separate models for each surface if sensitivity patterns differ significantly.
	6.	Integrate into the System:
	•	Implement the model in the game’s configuration workflow to automatically generate sensitivity values for new cars based on their attributes.
	7.	Test and Refine:
	•	Test the generated sensitivity values in the simulator.
	•	Refine the model if the predicted values deviate significantly from expected in-game behavior.

This approach provides a scalable way to automate FFB sensitivity settings while maintaining the flexibility to adjust as needed based on user feedback or new data.

For implementing a polynomial regression model in scikit-learn, you can use the following components:

Key Components in Scikit-learn

	1.	PolynomialFeatures (Feature Transformation):
	•	Found in sklearn.preprocessing.
	•	This transforms your input features into a polynomial feature set by adding higher-order terms (e.g., squares, cross-products).
	•	Example: If your features are weight and rotation, PolynomialFeatures will create weight, rotation, weight^2, rotation^2, and weight * rotation.
	2.	LinearRegression (Regression Model):
	•	Found in sklearn.linear_model.
	•	Fits the transformed polynomial features to predict the target variable (FFB sensitivity).
	•	While the model is still “linear” in the coefficients, the use of polynomial features makes it nonlinear in the input features.
	3.	Pipeline (Combining Steps):
	•	Found in sklearn.pipeline.
	•	Combines the polynomial feature transformation and regression into a single, reusable pipeline. This simplifies the workflow and ensures that feature transformation is applied consistently during both training and prediction.

Why These Components?

	•	PolynomialFeatures handles the creation of polynomial terms, so you don’t need to manually compute higher-order terms or interactions.
	•	LinearRegression provides a simple regression model that fits the expanded feature set.
	•	Pipeline ensures that feature transformation and model fitting/prediction are seamless and repeatable.

Alternative or Additional Components

	•	GridSearchCV (Hyperparameter Tuning):
	•	Found in sklearn.model_selection.
	•	Use this to optimize the polynomial degree or other hyperparameters.
	•	StandardScaler (Feature Scaling):
	•	Found in sklearn.preprocessing.
	•	Use this if feature values (e.g., weight in kg vs. lock-to-lock rotation in degrees) have drastically different scales.

These tools together will allow you to implement polynomial regression effectively for your FFB sensitivity problem. Let me know if you’d like detailed guidance on setting up the pipeline!
