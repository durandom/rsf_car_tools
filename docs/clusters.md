Based on the cluster statistics, here’s a breakdown of the characteristics of each cluster:

Cluster 0

	•	Size: 12 cars.
	•	Weight Range: 1119–1280 kg (moderate weight).
	•	Steering Rotation: 885–1116° (higher rotation, typical of older or less responsive steering systems).
	•	Drivetrain: All FWD (Front-Wheel Drive).
	•	Description:
	•	This cluster likely represents moderately heavy FWD cars with relatively high steering rotation.
	•	These vehicles are likely less agile but stable, suited for smoother surfaces like tarmac or less demanding gravel stages.

Cluster 1

	•	Size: 27 cars (largest cluster).
	•	Weight Range: 1390–1430 kg (heavy).
	•	Steering Rotation: 428–619° (low rotation, indicating more direct and modern steering systems).
	•	Drivetrain: Primarily AWD without torque split (50:50 power distribution) with a few AWD with torque split.
	•	Description:
	•	This cluster is dominated by modern, heavy AWD cars with direct steering.
	•	These cars are likely designed for high-performance, high-grip environments, excelling on tarmac and gravel.

Cluster 2

	•	Size: 16 cars.
	•	Weight Range: 1020–1430 kg (wide range from light to heavy).
	•	Steering Rotation: 864–1080° (medium to high rotation).
	•	Drivetrain: All RWD (Rear-Wheel Drive).
	•	Description:
	•	This cluster captures classic or sportier RWD cars, which likely have more neutral to oversteer-prone handling.
	•	They may require precise steering control, suitable for drivers who prefer challenging dynamics on all surfaces.

Cluster 3

	•	Size: 6 cars.
	•	Weight Range: 1300–1449 kg (heavy).
	•	Steering Rotation: 842–958° (medium-high rotation).
	•	Drivetrain: Mostly AWD without torque split (50:50), with one AWD with torque split.
	•	Description:
	•	Heavy AWD cars with balanced torque distribution, likely suited for rugged terrains like gravel and snow where stability is critical.
	•	The medium-high steering rotation suggests less responsiveness compared to modern AWD vehicles.

Cluster 4

	•	Size: 9 cars.
	•	Weight Range: 1230–1349 kg (moderate-heavy weight).
	•	Steering Rotation: 720–763° (medium rotation).
	•	Drivetrain: Predominantly FWD with one RWD.
	•	Description:
	•	This cluster represents slightly heavier FWD cars with moderately responsive steering systems.
	•	Likely versatile cars for various surfaces, balancing responsiveness and stability.

Cluster 5

	•	Size: 6 cars.
	•	Weight Range: 1319–1610 kg (very heavy).
	•	Steering Rotation: 720–778° (medium rotation).
	•	Drivetrain: Mostly AWD without torque split (50:50), with one AWD with torque split.
	•	Description:
	•	The heaviest cars in the dataset, these AWD vehicles are likely built for endurance and stability over rough terrains like gravel or snow.
	•	Medium steering rotation suggests reasonable responsiveness for their weight.

Cluster 6

	•	Size: 6 cars.
	•	Weight Range: 729–1005 kg (lightest cluster).
	•	Steering Rotation: 756–1080° (medium-high rotation).
	•	Drivetrain: Predominantly FWD with one RWD.
	•	Description:
	•	Light cars with higher steering rotation, indicating agile but less direct handling.
	•	Likely suited for drivers who prefer quick, nimble cars on technical stages.

Overall Description

	•	Cluster Distribution:
	•	Cluster 1 (heavy AWD) dominates the dataset, likely representing modern rally cars.
	•	Clusters 2, 3, 4, and 6 provide a mix of classic RWD, medium-weight FWD, and light vehicles, offering a range of dynamics.
	•	Surface Suitability:
	•	AWD-dominated clusters (1, 3, 5) excel in gravel or snow due to stability.
	•	FWD-dominated clusters (0, 4) are likely more efficient on smoother tarmac or less demanding gravel.
	•	RWD cluster (2) is versatile but challenging, requiring driver skill on loose surfaces.
